# book-list-project
Capstone Project Books/**bk-note-db** is the back up of the postgress db. Just import into pgadmin and start adding book notes.
The project is far from finished.
The nav bar is not fully buttoned down.
I have yet to add delete note. This should be easy.
**Wish list:**
I would like to add a rich text editor in the text area box
The preview image of the chosen file is not being properly positioned.
The Date Picket Icon is a bit too small.
The New Note form has no validation for the fields.
The multer module rejects any change of file name being uploaded. This means the file name entered into the form cannot be used.
FAQ & email link nothing done.
